# WebScrapingApp

A Basic web scraping app that will return how many times an entered URL is returned in the top 100 google results when a particular key word is searched and in what positions.

I attempted to add a database where I was going to store search history records that I was going to display on another tab on the search app however I ran into some issues with writing the data to the database that couldn't be resolved within the time period, so these changes were left off on a feature branch (see feature/20230815_AddDatabase).
